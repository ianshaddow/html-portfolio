<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ian Haddow and Ive long held the belief that coding and tech work were outside of my reach, let alone ability to understand.
  I recently challenged myself to go for it anyway and see what I could accomplish! I signed up for a full stack web developer
  bootcamp and was initially very intimidated by the amount that I felt I would need to learn, but told myself I wouldnt let myself be scared off.
  Im a week into the course now and am finding that the concepts and structure actually make a lot of sense to me!
  Im excited to see where this leads and to keep learning and pushing myself.
